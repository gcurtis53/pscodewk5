// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Input the first number 
Input the second number 
Add num1 and num2
Store the result in a variable
Output the sum



// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Take Number remainder=Number%2 if remainder==0; print even else print odd.



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a)Read n1,n2,n3,n4,n5

b)Write "The average is"
Set avg to (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5
Write avg of 3

c)If(n1 < n2)
 Set max to n2
Else
 Set max to n1
If(n3 > max)
 Set max to n3
If(n4 > max)
 Set max to n4
If(n5 > max)
Set max to n5
Write "The max is"
Write max of 5
If(n1 > n2)
 Set min to n2
Else
 Set min to n1
If(n3 < min)
 Set min to n3
If(n4 < min)
 Set min to n4
If(n5 < min)
Set min to n5
Write "The min is"
Write min of 5
